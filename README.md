## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of how decentralized and centralized finance can interact.

Here‚Äôs a detailed description of how **smart-contract-templates** would integrate with major centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.
